Pretty lame readme but here we go.

- android app is under "Play", go ahead and download it.
- currently setup to hit the GoogleAppEngine server i've got setup. But if that's down for any reason you can go into
'Request.java' and change the url field in the ctor to the address of the machine you want to setup the server on. The server setup instructions are under 'setup.txt'


cheers
